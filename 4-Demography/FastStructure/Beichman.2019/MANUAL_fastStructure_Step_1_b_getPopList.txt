## MANUAL STEP : don't run in the shell : get pop assignment file: (need list of populations in same order as list of samples) [manual] 

calldate=20180806 # date you called genotypes 

# and then manually make list of population assignments in order (is there a better way?)
indir=$SCRATCH/captures/vcf_filtering/${calldate}_filtered/plinkFormat # eventually going to be filtered SNP vcf (no monomorphic sites)
infilePREFIX=snp_7_downSampCOM_maxNoCallFrac_0.2_passingBespoke_passingAllFilters_postMerge_raw_variants
# old prefix snp_5_passingAllFilters_postMerge_raw_variants # the prefix of the .bed file
outdir=$SCRATCH/captures/analyses/FASTSTRUCTURE/${calldate}_filtered
backupdate=`date +%Y%m%d` # date for the backup (date you make your population assignments)
# first get the second column of the .fam file
awk '{print $2}' $indir/${infilePREFIX}.fam > $indir/${infilePREFIX}.samples

# !!!!! manually assign populations >>> and rename outfile to manual.popAssignment!!!!!
# *** MANUAL **** # nano $indir/${infilePREFIX}.samples -----> manually assign sample populations.
# make a back up:
cp $indir/${infilePREFIX}.manual.popAssignment $indir/${infilePREFIX}.manual.popAssignment.${backupdate}.bk # saving a backup just in case so you don't lose manual work

awk '{print $2}' $indir/${infilePREFIX}.manual.popAssignment > $indir/${infilePREFIX}.pops
# check if pop file exists, if it does, use it. Otherwise do not
