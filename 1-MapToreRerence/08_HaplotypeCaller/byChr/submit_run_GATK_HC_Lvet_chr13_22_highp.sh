# Run this script to make and submit job array scripts for each individual.
# Here, the for-loop is over the chromosomes and the array is over the individuals.
# The script is generated and submitted, and then overwritten with each subsequent iteration of the for-loop.

# Runtimes vary according to chromosome length.

# I submitted chromosome separately, in three parts.
# Chromosomes 01-12 were submitted with a 40-hr requested runtime.
# Chromosomes 13-22 were submitted with a 30-hr requested runtime.
# Chromosomes 23-38 were submitted with a 24-hr requested runtime in the 24-hr queue (not highp).

# Runtime is about twice as long if non-intel chips are used!
# Our group has only intel chips so I don't specify the architecture,
# but when I submit to the 24-hr queue I add arch=intel* to the -l line of the script header.

# Sometimes, for whatever reason, jobs would go slowly and run out of time and I just resubmitted
# those failed ones individually as needed.

# I'm not totally sure about the wisdom of using the --dontUseSoftClippedBases option, 
# but I know I used it last time, so I kept it here for consistency with the previous fox study.
